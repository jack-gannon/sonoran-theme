## Sonoran - Code Color Theme

This is Sonoran, a custom color theme for VSCode. For this particular color theme, I drew inspiration from the many colors of the sonoran desert, which is where I call home. I will be continuously improving this scheme over time to meet accessibility and legibility needs.

If you use it for syntax highlighting for your blog or similar projects, a credit would be awesome but not totally necessary.

**Enjoy!**
